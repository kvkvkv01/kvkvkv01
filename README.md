I am a **Software Engineering student** focused on low-latency C/C++ systems and quantitative finance, with experience in `numerical computing`, `data processing`, and `performance-critical software`.

I have experience developing complex analytical and infrastructure tools using `C/C++`, `Python`, and `Go`, and I am particularly interested in `latency-sensitive systems`, `AI/ML`, and `data-driven models`.

I study at École 42.
